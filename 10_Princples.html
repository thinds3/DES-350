<h2>Ten Principles of Design</h2>
	
	<h6><h3>1</h3><h4>Good design is innovative</h4><h5>All design is innovative because innovation the new. An individual beholds a new design with each 
		go around.<br>No two designs are the same. Your design is innovation and whether it is “good” is up to you.</br></h5>
	</h6>

	<p><h3>2</h3><h4>Good design makes a product useful</h4><h5>The statement is true within the boundaries of form following function. More so, I would
		agree<br>with this statement as long as the product is useful to the designer’s intended purpose.</br></h5>
	</p>
	
	
	<h6><h3>3</h3><h4>Good design is aesthetic</h4><h5>Not necessarily, the aesthetic may reside behind a message of chaos, or something
		without a true aesthetic.<br>The aesthetic relies within the authenticity of the maker’s vision.</br></h5>
	</h6>

	<h6><h3>4</h3><h4>Good design makes a product understandable</h4><h5>I believe this is true, but only to the limits of the product. How understandable is the product
		meant to be?<br>How understandable should the product be in regards to the product’s use?</br></h5>
	</h6>

	<p>
	<h6><h3>5</h3><h4>Good design is unobtrusive</h4><h5>I believe it is a good design if it isunobtrusive to what the design is expressing.</h5>
	</h6>
	</p>

	<h6><h3>6</h3><h4>Good design is honest</h4><h5>I agree strongly with this statement. However, you can still be honest and lie.<br>Contradicting indeed, however, great design lies honestly.</br></h5>
	</h6>

	<p>
	<h6><h3>7</h3><h4>Good design is long-lasting</h4><h5>I agree, if you make something unhinged to the boundaries of time, it is indeed good -<br>more so great
- because it has transcended multiple lifespans.</br></h5>
	</h6>
	</p>

	<h6><h3>8</h3><h4>Good design is thorough down to the last detail</h4><h5>Of course, certainly depends on how much detail the design beholds.However, you argue good
		design is thorough.<br>As long as it is just thorough, it is good. The reason I state such a thing is because
		we may find vast complexities</br>in the blandest “detail”. Thus being I believe it must be thorough,
the details will follow suit.</br></h5>
	</h6>

	<h6><h3>9</h3><h4>Good design is environmentally-friendly</h4><h5>Perhaps from a moral value yes, but is a coding design residing within
		the environment? Perhaps we must consider<br>the different environments under
the umbrella of the overall environment of existence.</br></h5>
	</h6>
	
	<p>
	<h6><h3>10</h3><h4>Good design is as little as possible</h4><h5>Interesting statement because little design may provide very complex layers.<br>While a very complex design may be portrayed in a rather simple fashion.</br></h5>
	</h6>
