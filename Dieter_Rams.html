<h1>Good design is innovative</h1>

<h2>All design is innovative because innovation is new. An individual beholds a new design with each go around. No two designs are the same. Your design is innovation, and whether it is “good” is up to you.</h2>
	
<h1>Good design makes a product useful</h1>

<h2>The statement is true within the boundaries of form following function. More so, I would agree with this statement as long as the product is useful to the designer’s intended purpose.</h2>
	
<h1>Good design is aesthetic
</h1>

<h2>Not necessarily, the aesthetic may reside behind a message of chaos, or something without a true aesthetic. The aesthetic relies within the authenticity of the maker’s vision.</h2>
	
<h1>Good design makes a product understandable
</h1>

<h2>I believe this is true, but only to the limits of the product. How understandable is the product meant to be? How understandable should the product be in regards to the product’s use?</h2>
	
<h1>Good design is unobtrusive
</h1>

<h2>I believe it is a good design if it is unobtrusive to what the design is expressing.</h2>
	
<h1>Good design is honest
</h1>

<h2>I agree strongly with this statement. However, you can still be honest and lie. Contradicting indeed, however, great design can be honest and lie.</h2>
	
<h1>Good design is long-lasting
</h1>

<h2>I agree, if you make something unhinged to the boundaries of time, it is indeed good - more so great - because it has transcended multiple lifespans.</h2>
	
<h1>Good design is thorough down to the last detail
</h1>

<h2>Of course, certainly depends on how much detail the design beholds. However, you argue good design is thorough. As long as it is just thorough, it is good. The reason I state such a thing is because we may find vast complexities in the blandest “detail”. Thus being I believe it must be thorough, the details will follow suit.</h2>
	
<h1>Good design is environmentally-friendly
</h1>

<h2>Perhaps from a moral value yes, but is a coding design residing within the environment? Perhaps we must consider the different environments under the umbrella of the overall environment of existence.</h2>
	
<h1>Good design is as little design as possible
</h1>

<h2>Interesting statement because little design may provide very complex layers. While a very complex design may be portrayed in a rather simple fashion.</h2>
